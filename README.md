# check_elaborati.sh
Easy bash script which checks the probability that two files are *"similar"*.

# Usage
This script checks all files inside the folder "elaborati", to see if some of them are similar or identical.
It gaves how much in percentage they are similar or, in case they are identical, a RED alert.

To use the script simply run:

./check_elaborati.sh

Thanks to my students for the tips about this project :)
